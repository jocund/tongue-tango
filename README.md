This repository contains the source code for the **Spice Fusion** product website — a fully responsive, static one-page site hosted on **GitHub Pages** and connected to a custom domain.

The website showcases the **Tongue Tango Hot Sauce Pepper Challenge Kit**, including:
- A hero section
- Product gallery with 10-image carousel
- Product information
- Stripe Buy Button for checkout
- Contact and footer sections with custom backgrounds

Everything is built with lightweight web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and requires **no backend**.
